     <p>My name is Isinkaye Praise.</p>
      <p>Funny how I never really liked computers, not the technical aspect anyway. Years ago, computer to me was just for watching movies, playing games and typing what needed printing. </p>
      <p>I decided to start learning <i>tech</i> last year and it is one of the best decisions I've made. I started learning Python as something to while away time with but I didn't understand <i>computer technology</i> then. I wasn't even sure what it was used for but it got me interested in programming. Then I decided on an aspect where i could immediately see the result of what I was writing which led me to web development. Understanding how websites and applications were made was new and intriguing to me. Learning and being able to build one by myself from the scratch is so much fun even though it gets difficult a lot.</p>

      <p>We started learning with basic computer studies where I learnt parts and uses of computers and many others.</p>
      <p>After that, I learnt about version control system(Git) and how it is used. It is used for saving files, tracking changes in files and collaborating with other developers on projects.</p>
      <p>I learnt <b>HTML</b> which is the <i>structure</i> of a webpage. I learnt the tags used, how to use them and when to use them.</p>
      <p>Next, we moved to CSS(Cascading Style Sheet). Just as HTML is for building the structure, CSS is used for <i>styling</i> this structure. It gives it the design needed to make it beautiful.</p>

      <p>Padding refers to the space around a content. In a box model, it is used to fix the <b>space</b> between the <b>content</b> and the <b>border</b>.</p>
      <p>Margin is the <b>space</b> around a content <b>outside any defined borders</b>. It is used to create extra space around an element</p>
      <p>Borders are box-like lines around a content. It is used to separate or draw attention to a content on a webpage. It comes <b>between</b> the <b>padding</b> and <b>margin</b>.</p>
